    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >The only thing that smells better than bacon in the morning, is bacon for lunch and dinner. Lucky for us, Allrecipes has thousands of recipes that feature bacon, so you could eat bacon for….well, every meal. And for a very long time. But where should you start?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >For the first time ever, Allrecipes is looking to crown the “best recipe” of the year in five popular categories: cheese, potatoes, chocolate, bacon, and chicken. Our editors chose 10 recipes per category that represent what our community is making right now on Allrecipes—whether that’s something highly rated, brimming with comments on Instagram, or very much in the zeitgeist in 2023 (hello, bacon twists). And now we need your help: <b> for your favorite bacon recipe below, then enter your email, click submit, and you could win $1,000!</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >When the voting period ends, the top two recipes in each category will go to an official cook-off in our test kitchen where a panel of expert judges will declare which dish will claim the #1 spot. The best recipes of 2023 will be announced on September 6, 2023 online at Allrecipes.com and in our holiday print issue.
