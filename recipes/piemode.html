    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >Cheese is the literal magic sauce in our mac and cheese, the tour de force in our enchiladas, and the wind beneath (or on top of) our pizza. If we had to choose one cheese recipe to reign above the rest this year, it would seem like an impossible task. Cruel, even. But that’s exactly what we’re asking you to help us do.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >For the first time ever, Allrecipes is looking to crown the “best recipe” of the year in five popular categories: cheese, potatoes, chocolate, bacon, and chicken. Our editors chose 10 recipes per category that represent what our community is making right now on Allrecipes—whether that’s something highly rated, brimming with comments on Instagram, or very much in the zeitgeist in 2023 (like TikTok’s pickle in a blanket). And now we need your help:<b> vote for your favorite cheese recipe below, then enter your email, click submit, and you could win $1,000!</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" >When the voting period ends, the top two recipes in each category will go to an official cook-off in our test kitchen where a panel of expert judges will declare which dish will claim the #1 spot. The best recipes of 2023 will be announced on September 6, 2023 online at Allrecipes.com and in our holiday print issue.
